# Automatic malware verification

## What
Sending syslog based on inbound hash/url. Used as an external system to verify hashes, URLs and files. 

## Logic
In:
> url: malicious-url\r\n
> hash: hash\r\n
> syslog\_target: target\r\n (optional)

Out: 
> 31-07-2017 12:38:11, severity: low, yara localscan: False, hash: 545C38B0922DE19734FBFFDE62792C37C2AEF6A3216CFA472449173165220F7D, xforce: low, virustotal: 0/59, scantime: 2017-07-28 14:18:25

## Todo
* Yara support based on URL
* Exploit kit check?
* Make it based on API calls rather than pure sockets
* Add it to the mongoserver project
* Arbitrary syslog target handler (might be missused)
* OpenOffice Draw \o/
