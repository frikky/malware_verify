# Malware stuff
New version of malware_verification. 

## Pipeline
Will eventually draw this up properly

1. SIEM (hash/url) 	- Hash/URL to below
2. server.py		- Sends hash to below
3. Virustotal		- > Malicious findings
3. Xforce			- > Low finding
4. IF no finding, download file from URL -> redo step 3 with file, not hash
4. Check downloaded file with Yara
5. > Low in VT -> Send alarm back to SIEM

## TODO
* Properly set up Virustotal and XForce tests
* Add file submitting for VT and XForce
* Add URL support for VT and XForce
* Setup Yara properly (Got a python script available):
*** https://github.com/Neo23x0/signature-base
*** https://github.com/Yara-Rules/rules
* Send alarm back to SIEM (got code ready, just not ported)
* Connect to mongoserver (API) - (Code porting needed) - Capybara.services
